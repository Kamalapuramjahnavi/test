<img src = " images\neeraj chopra.jfif" height ="450" width = "90%">
<p>Neeraj Chopra etched his name in history by becoming the first Indian track and field athlete to clinch a gold medal at Olympics.</p>
<p>Neeraj Chopra won a gold medal in the 2016 IAAF World U20 Championships in Bydgoszcz, Poland and set a world junior record of 86.48 m, becoming the first Indian athlete to achieve a world record, at the same time setting a new national record. 
Chopra was one of the fittest athletes on the track in Tokyo 2020. But he was not quite so when he first started. It was, in fact, his interest to become a javelin thrower that brought discipline into his life.</p>
