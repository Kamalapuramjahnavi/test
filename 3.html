<p>It’s normal to experience side effects after the vaccine. It shows the vaccine is teaching your body’s immune system how to protect itself from the disease, however not everyone gets them.

Most of these are mild and short term. They may include:

having a painful, heavy feeling and tenderness in the arm where you had your injection
headache or muscle ache
joint pain
chills
nausea or vomiting
feeling tired
fever (temperature above 37.8°C).</p>
<p>These common side effects are much less serious than developing coronavirus or complications associated with coronavirus and they usually go away within a few days.If you feel uncomfortable, you can rest and take paracetamol. Make sure you take paracetamol as directed on the label or leaflet.</p>
